# AgriVerse 🌾

## Overview
AgriVerse is an AI-based Farmer Query Support and Advisory System developed as part of **Smart India Hackathon 2025**.  
The platform empowers farmers with real-time, multilingual, and voice-based agricultural guidance while ensuring supply chain transparency using blockchain technology.

## Problem Statement
AI Based Farmer Query Support and Advisory System  
**Problem Statement ID:** SIH25076  
**Theme:** Agriculture, Food Tech, and Rural Development  
**Category:** Software

## Solution Summary
AgriVerse provides instant AI-driven advisory to farmers on:
- Crop management
- Irrigation guidance
- Weather alerts
- Pest and disease detection (image-based)

To build trust and transparency, blockchain is used to track agricultural produce from farm to consumer. Consumers can scan QR codes to verify product origin, quality, and farming practices.

## Key Features
- 🌐 Multilingual & voice-based farmer support  
- 🤖 AI-powered crop and disease advisory  
- 🌦️ Real-time weather and irrigation alerts  
- 🔗 Blockchain-based supply chain traceability  
- 📦 QR code verification for consumers  
- 💸 Smart contracts for direct farmer payments  

## Technology Stack
- **AI/ML:** Python (TensorFlow / PyTorch)  
- **Blockchain:** Hyperledger Fabric / Ethereum  
- **Smart Contracts:** Solidity / Chaincode  
- **Database:** MongoDB / IPFS  
- **Frontend:** React / Angular + Android App  
- **Cloud:** AWS / Azure / Government Datacenter  

## Technology Readiness Level (TRL)
**TRL 5 – Prototype Validated in Simulated Environment**  
The core components such as AI advisory, multilingual interface, and blockchain tracking are implemented and tested in a controlled environment. Large-scale real-world deployment is the next step.
